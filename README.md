# Input Validation and Sanitization Example

This is an example project that demonstrates how to validate and sanitize user input in Python to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

## Introduction

User input is an essential part of many applications, but it can also be a source of security vulnerabilities if not properly handled. This project provides a simple implementation of input validation and sanitization techniques to mitigate risks associated with malicious user input.

## Features

- Validates user input to check for potentially malicious characters.
- Sanitizes input by removing HTML tags and special characters.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd your-repository
```

3. Run the script:

```
python input_validation.py
```

4. Enter your input when prompted.

## Code Explanation

The `input_validation.py` script contains the following key components:

- `sanitize_input` function: This function uses regular expressions to remove HTML tags and special characters from the input string.

- `validate_input` function: This function checks if the input string contains potentially malicious characters using regular expressions. 
- It raises a `ValueError` if any such characters are found.

- Example usage: The script demonstrates the usage of the `validate_input` and `sanitize_input` functions. It prompts the user for input, 
- validates and sanitizes it, and then prints the sanitized input.

## Security Considerations

While this project provides a basic implementation of input validation and sanitization, it is important to note that security is a complex and evolving field. 
It is recommended to consult relevant security guidelines and best practices to ensure the safety of your application. Additionally, consider implementing other security measures such as 
parameterized queries for database interactions and output encoding to protect against various types of attacks.
